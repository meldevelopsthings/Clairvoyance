# Clairvoyance

Clairvoyance is the solution to being unorganised. Whether it be chores or work related, Clairvoyance can be tweaked and customised in a simple manner to allow any authenticated user to manage their time effectively. Teams allow for the collaboration between users within their kanban boards, ideal for study groups, work teams and more. 

This project was made for university coursework.
